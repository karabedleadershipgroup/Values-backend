## How the App Works

1. User sees a **confidentiality gate** (beta testing terms) and must click "I Agree" to enter
2. **Step 1:** User enters organizational values (type or tap common values chips)
3. **Step 2:** User describes the staff behavior and selects first time or repeated
4. Frontend builds a **system prompt** and sends it to `/api/analyze`
5. `analyze.js` calls the Anthropic API and returns structured JSON
6. Results are displayed across several sections (see below)
7. User can click **Listen** to hear an ElevenLabs audio summary (Rachel voice)
8. User can click **PDF** to download a print-ready report

---

## Results Sections (in display order)

1. **Behavior Observed** — faithful restatement of what the user typed, no embellishment
2. **Staff's Possible Reality** — compassionate possibilities for what may be driving the behavior (trauma, burnout, mental health, family stress)
3. **Values Analysis** — each value marked Misaligned or Upheld with explanation
4. **Impact** — client, team, and organizational impact
5. **Values-Aligned Behavior** — what the behavior looks like when aligned (framed positively)
6. **Conversation Guide** — five-part script in this order:
   - Opening
   - Curiosity question
   - Observation + impact
   - Shared expectation
   - Alignment statement
7. **Recommended Next Step** — Coach, Document, or Escalate with reasoning

## System Prompt Design Principles

The system prompt lives inside the `generate()` function in `index.html`. Key rules baked into the prompt:

- **Trauma-informed language only** — no "I need you to", "you must", "you have to", "this is unacceptable"
- **Invitational and curious tone** — "I'm wondering...", "I'd like to explore...", "What I noticed was..."
- **Expectations framed as shared commitments** — "As a team, we're committed to..."
- **No shaming language** anywhere in the output
- **behaviorObserved must be faithful** to what the user typed — no added details or assumptions
- **staffReality** offers warm, human context for the leader to hold — not an excuse for behavior
- **First time vs. repeated** adjusts the tone: first time = curiosity and care; repeated = warm but clear, names the pattern without blame

## Change History

### Session: April 15, 2026

**Changes made to `index.html`:**
- Added ElevenLabs audio integration (replaced browser speech synthesis)
  - Listen button calls `/api/speak` which returns audio from ElevenLabs
  - Rachel voice, `eleven_multilingual_v2` model
  - Full audio player with play/pause, seek ±15s, progress bar
- Added confidentiality gate screen (beta testing terms, must agree before entering)
- Added common nonprofit values quick-select chips (28 values, tap to add/remove)
- Rewrote system prompt with full trauma-informed language rules
- Renamed "Correct behavior" → "Values-aligned behavior"
- Renamed "Conversation script" → "Conversation guide"
- Renamed "Expectation" → "Shared expectation"
- Renamed "Behavior + impact" → "Observation + impact"
- Renamed "Recommended action" → "Recommended next step"
- Added `staffReality` field — "Staff's possible reality" section
- Reordered conversation guide: Curiosity question now appears after Opening
- Added CRITICAL instruction: `behaviorObserved` must not add or invent details
- PDF updated to match all UI changes

**Added `api/speak.js`:**
- New backend route for ElevenLabs text-to-speech
- Uses Rachel voice ID: `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`
- Reads `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` from Vercel environment variables
- Returns audio/mpeg stream

**`api/audio.js`:** Mark for deletion — superseded by `speak.js`

## Important Notes for Future Sessions

- Always pull `index.html` from GitHub at the start of a session before making changes
- The system prompt is inside `index.html` in the `generate()` function — there is no separate prompt file
- The JSON schema returned by the AI must include: `behaviorObserved`, `staffReality`, `valuesAnalysis`, `impact`, `valuesAlignedBehavior`, `conversationScript`, `recommendedAction`
- `conversationScript` keys: `opening`, `curiosityQuestion`, `behaviorImpact`, `expectation`, `alignmentStatement`
- After any change to `index.html`, commit to GitHub — Vercel redeploys automatically
- If Vercel is serving an old version, go to the Vercel dashboard and click Redeploy
